/*

A packet analyzer (also known as a network analyzer, protocol analyzer or packet snifferâ€”or, for particular types of networks, an Ethernet sniffer or wireless sniffer) is a computer program or piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic that passes over a digital network or part of a network. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications. [32] Wireshark for example is the most popular packet sniffer out there and is available for all platforms. Its gui based and very easy to use.

//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer

In this chapter we are going to talk about how to code and make our own packet sniffer in C and on the linux platform. 

Note that it sniffs only incoming packets. [33]
